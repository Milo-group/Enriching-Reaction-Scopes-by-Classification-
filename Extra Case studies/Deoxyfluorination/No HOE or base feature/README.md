The datasets provided do not include one-hot encoded (HOE) vectors, and the base feature ```base_*N1_exposed_area``` has been removed. 
This feature was identified as a base descriptor in the work by Doyle and coworkers, as noted in our SI. 
As a result, only substrate-related features are retained.
For each one of the sulfonyls we provided a dataset under the name  ```Sulfonyl_XX_final.csv ``` with XX being the type of sulfonyl. 
In the data set the tags of the molecules and the Inchies for each molecule is supplied along with all the features and the class output.
